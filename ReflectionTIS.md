🪞 Reflection: Technology and Information System (TIS)
The Technology and Information System course has given me a much clearer perspective on how digital infrastructure fuels modern organizations. It emphasized that information systems aren’t just support tools—they’re critical drivers of innovation, strategy, and operational excellence.
📌 Key Insights
- I built a strong foundation in the core components of IT systems, including hardware, software, networks, and databases. Understanding how these elements interact helped me appreciate the complexity of even the simplest user-facing applications.
- Learning about enterprise platforms like ERP and CRM opened my eyes to how businesses streamline processes and make data-driven decisions.
- Hands-on assignments, such as the industry poster, report writing, video reflection, and IEEE-style paper, gave me the opportunity to explore real-world implementations of tech solutions and analyze how companies use ICT to gain a competitive edge.
- The discussions on emerging technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and big data sparked my interest in how these tools can drive transformation across industries.
⚙️ Overcoming Challenges
At the beginning, interpreting technical frameworks like cloud architecture and system integrations felt a bit abstract. But analyzing real-world case studies and engaging in industry visits made these concepts come alive. Working in teams also helped refine my collaboration skills, especially when aligning different perspectives into a cohesive tech proposal.
🌱 Looking Ahead
This course laid a solid foundation for exploring how technology and business strategy intersect. It’s inspired me to think beyond functionality and consider long-term scalability, usability, and value creation in everything I build. I’m excited to apply these insights as I continue working on AI-driven systems and smart automation projects.
