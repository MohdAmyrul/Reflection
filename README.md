üñ•Ô∏è Computer Organisation and Architecture (COA)
This course deepened my understanding of how computers function at the hardware level. Through topics like instruction cycles, memory hierarchy, and assembly programming, I developed a strong grasp of how software interacts with hardware. Writing and debugging low-level programs sharpened my attention to detail and cultivated a system-level mindset‚Äîskills I‚Äôll carry into embedded systems and AI-integrated solutions.
Key Growth: Gained precision in low-level logic, improved debugging skills, and understood performance optimization from a processor‚Äôs perspective.


üß© System and Design (SAD)
SAD was a transformative experience that honed both my creative and analytical thinking. Learning about SDLC and design thinking gave me a structured approach to problem-solving that‚Äôs centered around user needs. My experience developing low-fidelity prototypes in Figma, especially for the smart cooking assistant, taught me how to translate abstract ideas into functional interfaces.
Key Growth: Adopted a user-centric mindset, mastered design workflows, and strengthened collaboration and ideation skills.


üíª Technology and Information System (TIS)
TIS provided the big-picture view of how technology powers modern businesses. From core IT infrastructure to enterprise systems like ERP and CRM, I learned how digital tools drive strategic decisions. Case studies, industry talks, and assignments helped link theory with real-world practices, and inspired me to explore the intersection of AI and business technology.
Key Growth: Developed systems-level awareness of business-IT alignment, explored emerging tech, and improved communication through technical writing and presentations.
