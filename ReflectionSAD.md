ðŸªž Reflection: System and Design
Taking the System and Design course has been a highly enriching experience that reshaped how I approach problem-solving. It taught me to think not only logically but also empatheticallyâ€”placing users at the center of each design decision.
âœ¨ Key Takeaways
- Iâ€™ve developed a stronger appreciation for design thinking, especially how it encourages structured creativity. Going through each phaseâ€”from empathizing to prototypingâ€”pushed me to consider practical functionality while prioritizing user experience.
- Building low-fidelity prototypes using tools like Figma helped me translate abstract ideas into visual concepts. This was especially useful during the design of our smart cooking system interface, where usability and simplicity were key.
- Working through the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) gave me a deeper understanding of how to manage complex projects step-by-step. The emphasis on planning and feedback cycles taught me how to anticipate challenges early.
ðŸ”§ Overcoming Challenges
- One of the hurdles I faced was aligning technical functionality with user needs. Our initial designs werenâ€™t as intuitive as expected, which led me to revisit user stories and adapt the flow to better reflect real interactions.
- Collaborating within a team also taught me to appreciate different problem-solving perspectives. It was a learning curve, but one that sharpened my communication and coordination skills.
ðŸŒ± Looking Ahead
This subject has laid a strong foundation for my future work, especially in areas like IoT and AI-integrated systems. I now understand how vital human-centered design is in building technology thatâ€™s not just innovative, but truly useful.
